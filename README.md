# TFMG Stellaris Compat

This mod integrates Stellaris with Create: The Factory Must Grow. It removes overlapping Stellaris tech, aligns recipes with Create/TFMG materials and processes, and reworks machines to fit in with TFMG style. 
This will make the progression harder, but going to space is pretty hard so I think it's balanced.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- Neoforge 21.1.190
- [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)
- [Create: The Factory Must Grow](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-tfmg)
- [Stellaris](https://modrinth.com/mod/stellaris)

## Features

#### Reworked recipes

Many Stellaris recipes were changed to better fit with Create and TFMG.
JEI/REI/EMI is recommended for checking the new recipes.

#### Machines

Most Stellaris machines are removed or reworked to better fit TFMG.

RTG:
- Replaces the Stellaris Radioactive Generator
- Consumes radioactive fuels from Stellaris
- Produces variable power and voltage depending on the fuel’s “power level” (based on radioactivity and,
  especially, refinement)
- No GUI: input fuel via hoppers, chutes, or other Create input methods

Solar Panel:
- Flat voltage and power generation
- Doesn't work at night

#### Configuration

You can configure many parameters to suit your gameplay:
- RTG: power, voltage, burn time
- Solar Panel: power and voltage

You can find them in the Create configuration menu.

## Feedback and Bugs

This is my first Minecraft mod, so there may be some bugs or issues I missed in testing.

Thanks to the Create, TFMG, and Stellaris teams for their amazing work.
